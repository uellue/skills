#   record.sh            records into the next free run-<n> under ~/field-test (run-0 the first time), until `exit`;
#                        the run's folder also gets notes.md, your notes about the test
#   record.sh --next     only prints the folder the next recording would use
#   record.sh --pack [N] packs run-N (default: the latest) into ~/field-test/run-N.tar.gz, the run's evidence as one file
#
# Inside the recorded shell, FIELD_TEST_RUN is the run's folder.
#
# Written as it goes (-f), so a run can be followed live and survives a crash (run 0, 2026-11-09).
# The first time, it asks before creating ~/field-test (FIELD_TEST_DIR overrides it). Output and timing only:
# never --log-in, which would record every key, passwords included. An existing run folder is never reused;
# nothing is deleted.

# The run folder and the archive are the owner's alone (on a shared machine others could read what the terminal
# showed); the recorded shell keeps the person's own umask, so the session itself is not changed.
